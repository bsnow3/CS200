Sample values for average: 3 2 1
output should be 2
output was 5.33

void Test_Average()
{
	int ave = 2;
	int avetest = Average(3, 2, 1);
	if (ave != avetest)
	{
		cout << "Fail" << endl;
	}
	else
		cout << "Pass" << endl;
}

there was no parenthesis around "a + b + c"
causing the order of operations to take effect.

sample values for max:  2 3 4
expected output is 4
return was 3

void Test_Max()
{
	int max = 4;
	int maxtest = Max(2, 3, 4);
	if (max != maxtest)
	{
		cout << "Fail" << endl;
	}
	else
		cout << "Pass" << endl;
}

The function only checked if A was less than
B, not B against C, or C against A.

Factorial test value: 4
expected value: 24
void Test_Factorial()
{
	int fac = 24;
	int factest = Factorial(4);
	if (fac != factest)
	{
		cout << "Fail " << factest << endl;
	}
	else
		cout << "Pass " << factest << endl;
	while (true);
}

i needed to be compared greater than 1 and decremented after starting the loop.

FormatName input: bradly snow
output : snow,bradly
void Test_FormatName()
{
	string form = "snow, bradly";
	string formtest = FormatName("bradly", "snow");
	if (form != formtest)
	{
		cout << "Fail " << endl;
	}
	else
		cout << "Pass " << endl;
	while (true);
}

there needed to be a space after the comma in the string in the return line of the function.
